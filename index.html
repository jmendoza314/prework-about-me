      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm 32 years old looking for a career change. My background is in law enforcement but I've always been interested in technology and with coding. </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born and raised in Fontana, CA.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Favorite hobbies include spending as much time that I can with my 5 year old son. We loved going to Disneyland (pre-Covid), golfing and reading with him.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p> If I can make a living off it, my dream job would be a grounds keeper for any Major League baseball team. </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Still living in Fontana!</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Being a web developer, or learning to code gives me an opportunity to create. I was an artist growing up so in many ways coding would give me unlimited possibilities to create.</p>
